I'm changing something that ill change back later
List of git Commands:

Clone: all machines are in sync after you synchronize

$git init: initializes and now, you can start committing code!

$git add filename: adds file to staging area

$git status: checks status of changes

$git diff filename: after editing files, since files are tracked, we can check the difference between the working directory and the staging area.

$git commit: last step in Git workflow, permanently stores changes from staging area to the repository

$git commit -m "followed by a message": makes a comment to tell you what the commits changed

$git log: commits are stored chronologically in repository, so this allows the commit messages to be viewed and when you committed them.

$git show HEAD: output will display everything the git log command displays for the HEAD commit(the most recent commit) and all the file changes that were committed.

$git checkout HEAD filename: will restore file in working directory to what it was when you made the last commit.

$git reset HEAD filename: unstages that file from the staging area/
